screen.

<h3>
Usage</h3>
Start with GUI: java -jar dcm.jar
<br>Start in Batch mode: java -jar dcm.jar &lt;dir to import> [destination.crt]
<h3>
Limitations</h3>
The following cart types are supported:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ocean
<p>Because of technical limitations only a single OCEAN cart may be added.
<br>Unsupported carts are omitted during import.
<h3>
Description</h3>
The table in the main window displays programs and cartridges available
on the current multicart.
<br>Use drag &amp; drop or the "+"-button to add programs or cartridges.
<br>Edit names in the first column of the table by double clicking them.
<br>Save your cart using the "Save" button.
<br>Sort the multicarts contents by a mouseclick on the first tablecolumn
or the "A-Z" button.
<h3>
Cart Size (1M/2M)</h3>
Please make sure to select the right cart size for your hardware.
<br>For EasyFlash carts currently available this would be "1MB".
<br>If to many data is added to a cart the filling level display turns
red while showing a value >100% which indicates that the cart can't be
programmed to the selcted hardware (1MB/2MB EasyFlash). It can be saved
with the "Save" button though.
<h3>
Screensaver and splashscreen</h3>
With the "Boot" button an EasyFlash splashscreen can be added. The splashscreen
appears during initial boot.
<br>The "Screens." button adds a screensaver that is invoked by EasyLoader
after a while if no user interaction takes place.
<h3>
A-Z button (sort function)</h3>
The list of carts and programs is sorted automatically if the “A-Z” button
is active.
<br>A sorted list is preqequisite for the search function&nbsp; in carts
menue (EasyLoader).
<br>Anyway if you require a custom list you may disable the sorting using
the "A-Z" button.
<br>If sorting is disabled the up/down buttons become available allowing
selected items to be moved to another position.
<h3>
Banks</h3>
The "Banks" button opens a view that displays the current bank usage. Each
bank represents a 8KB chunk of memory.
<h3>
Add / + / Drag &amp; Drop</h3>
Use "+" button, the "Add" menu or Drag&amp;Drop to add new files to the
cart. Files must have the extension ".crt" or ".prg".
<br>If a directory is added then all *.crt and *.prg files are added from
that directory.
<h3>
Remove / -</h3>
Use "-" button or "Remove" menu to remove selected entries from the cart.
Multiple entries can be selected (press shift or ctrl when selecting).
<h3>
Up</h3>
The "Up" button or menu moves selected entries up one row (only available
if sort function is disabled).
<h3>
Down</h3>
Use "Down" button / menu to move selected entries down one row (only available
if sort function is disabled).
<h3>
Export</h3>
The "Export" button / menu exports as much multicart contents as possible
